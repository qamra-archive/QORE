# QORE

QAMRA-Core (QORE) is an attempt to provide the technical platform for the archiving efforts undertaken by QAMRA. This is a fast evolving project which would take shape as a set of APIs, front-end application or possibly even as a protocol that enables archiving (both offline and online) and digital exhibition.

Please visit the project wiki to understand the requirements, design and constraints better.
