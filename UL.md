# Ubiquitous Language for QORE

This document describes the [Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) to be used by the users, developers and other stakeholders of the project. This should serve as more than just a dictionary of the terminology used across the project and should rather be regarded as a documentation of evolution of the understanding about the project and its eco-system. This document would continue to evolve and grow (or shrink) as the understanding about the project matures.

(Please note that at the initial stage, we would refrain from spending effort on finding ways to structure the different terms defined in this document. As enough terminology is discovered and defined, a structure is expected to emerge organically.)

## QORE
*This forms the core of the application hence the name: QAMRA-Core. Expect this to have the core set of APIs that would be used to access and edit the documents, configuration and other aspects of the archive*
